# 🚀 Real-Time Object Detection Web App

A full-stack **object detection application** built with **React.js (frontend)** and **Django REST + YOLOv8 (backend)**, fully deployed on **Render**.  
Users can upload images, and the app returns annotated images with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores in real-time.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 📤 Upload any image via the React frontend  
- 🔍 Detect objects in real-time using **YOLOv8 Nano** model  
- 🖼️ Annotated images with bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores  
- ⚡ Lightweight model for **fast inference & low memory usage**  
- ☁️ Fully deployed with **Render** (frontend + backend)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React.js  
**Backend:** Django REST Framework, Gunicorn  
**Machine Learning:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
**Image Processing:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow  
**Deployment:** Render

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User uploads an image via the React frontend.  
2. The image is sent to the Django REST API.  
3. **YOLOv8 Nano model** performs object detection.  
4. Bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores are generated.  
5. Annotated image + detection data are returned to the frontend.  
6. Results are displayed in an **interactive, user-friendly UI**.
